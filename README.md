# Elective Array

Sometimes it's really hard to select your classes for the upcoming school year, especially electives. This year, you can chose from photography, ceramics, music, robotics, web development, and an independent study.

We're going to use test driven development(TDD) to write a set of methods that will help us organize and choose our electives for the year. TDD means that we have written tests (code that checks to see if your code is returning what it is supposed to) that you can use to guide your work. The file where you will write your code is called `elective.rb` and the tests are in the spec directory in a file called `elective_spec.rb`

As you work, remember to constantly run `rspec` in terminal in the lab directory. It's how you'll test that you're getting the correct outcomes!

Let's start to organize all of our options.  Don't forget to constantly run `rspec` in terminal in the lab directory. It's how you'll test that you're getting the correct outcomes!
