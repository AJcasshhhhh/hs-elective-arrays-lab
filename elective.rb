# I've created an array called 'electives' for you to use to test your methods out.
electives = ["photography", "ceramics", "music", "robotics", "web development", "independent study"]

#code your solutions

#1: Create a method called print_array that takes an array as an argument and outputs the whole array to the screen using puts. 
def print_array(array)
  #write your code here
end

#2: Create a method called count_items that takes an array as an argument and RETURNS (don't use puts) the number of items in the array. Take a look through the Ruby documentation to see if there is an array method built in to ruby that can help you count the items. 
def count_items(array)

end


#3: Create a method called first_item that takes an array as an argument and returns the first item in the array.


#4: Create a method called last_item that takes an array as an argument and returns the last item in the array. 


#5: Create a method called alphabetical_first that takes an array as an argument and returns the first item from an array when it is sorted in alphabetical order. 


#6: Create a method called random_item that will return a random item from an array that is given as an argument.


#7: Create a method called reverse_each that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns another array where the strings have each been reversed.


#8: After mulling over these elective options, you've decided you don't want to take an independent study anymore. Write a method that pops off the last item in the array.


#9: Now you're not sure, maybe you do want an independent study. Write a method that pushes independent study back onto the array.


# Bonus Items: Your school has decided that before you can take an elective you have to pass some tests to make sure sure you're not a robot!

#8: Create a method called sum that takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of all of the numbers in the array.


#9: Create a method called average that takes an array as an argument and returns the mean average of all of the numbers in the array.


#10: Double Bonus! Write a method called length_finder that takes in an array of strings and returns an array containing the length of each of those strings.
