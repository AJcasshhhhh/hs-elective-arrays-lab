# I've created an array called 'electives' for you to use to test your methods out.
electives = ["photography", "ceramics", "music", "robotics", "web development", "independent study"]


#code your solutions

#1: Create a method called print_array that takes an array as an argument and outputs the whole array to the screen using puts. (We've set up the method structure for you here)
def print_array(arr)

end

#2: Create a method called count_items that takes an array as an argument and RETURNS (don't use puts) the number of items in the array. (We've set up the method structure for you here)
def count_items(arr)

end


#3: Create a method called first_item that takes an array as an argument and returns the first item in the array.


#4: Create a method called last_item that takes an array as an argument and returns the last item in the array. 


#5: Create a method called alphabetical_first that takes an array as an argument and returns the first item from an array when it is sorted in alphabetical order.


#6: Create a method called random_item that will return a random item from an array that is given as an argument.


#7: Create a method called reverse_each that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns another array where the strings have each been reversed.


# Hold on! Before you can take an elective you have to pass a test to make sure sure you're not a robot!

#8: Create a method called sum that takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of all of the numbers in the array.


#9: Create a method called average that takes an array as an argument and returns the mean average of all of the numbers in the array.


#10: Bonus! Given an array containing some strings, write a method called length_finder that returns an array containing the length of those strings.
